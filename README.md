TOPP
====

**NOTE: Starting June 2018, TOPP will no longer be actively maintained. Please use [TOPP-RA](https://github.com/hungpham2511/toppra), which provides all functionalities supported by TOPP while being faster and more robust (100% success rate guaranteed).**

This is TOPP, the Time-Optimal Path Parameterization library by Quang-Cuong Pham (cuong.pham@normalesup.org).

If you use this library for your research, please reference the accompanying paper [«A general, fast, and robust implementation of the time-optimal path parameterization algorithm»](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6895310/), *IEEE Transactions on Robotics*, vol. 30(6), pp. 1533–1540, 2014.

If you use Admissible Velocity Propagation, please reference also [«Admissible Velocity Propagation: Beyond quasi-static path planning for high-dimensional robots»](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0278364916675419), *The International Journal of Robotics Research*, vol. 36(1), pp. 44–67, 2017.

Many thanks to Stéphane Caron, Rosen Diankov, Puttichai Lertkultanon, and others, for their contributions!

Requirements 
------------

The following software is required to install TOPP:

- Python (2.7 or above), with numpy, scipy and matplotlib
- Boost (1.46 or above), with Boost.Python

If you need OpenRAVE support (for dynamics computations), the following software is also required:

- OpenRAVE (installed from source, "master" branch, see http://openrave.org/docs/latest_stable/coreapihtml/installation_linux.html **NB**: one must install from the "master" branch, not the "latest stable" branch, so change <code>git clone --branch latest_stable https://github.com/rdiankov/openrave.git</code> into <code>git clone --branch master https://github.com/rdiankov/openrave.git</code>)

Installation
------------

Follow the standard installation procedure: from the TOPP directory,
  
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    sudo make install

TOPP will be compiled with OpenRAVE support if the latter is found on your system.

Examples
